# Mongoose Express CRUD Mastery
**Objective:** Develop a Node.js Express application with TypeScript as the programming language, integrating MongoDB with Mongoose for user data and order management. Ensure data integrity through validation using Joi/Zod.

### Set up the Project

- Create a new Node.js Express project.
- Set up a MongoDB database using Mongoose for storing user and order data.

### Define Data Models

- Create Mongoose models for User and Order based on the provided data structure.
- Define appropriate data types, validations.

### Data Types List

- `username` (string): The username of the user.
- `password` (string): The password of the user.
- `fullName` (object): An object containing the first and last name of the user.
    - `firstName` (string): The first name of the user.
    - `lastName` (string): The last name of the user.

- `address` (object): An object containing the street, city, and country of the user's address.
    - `street` (string): The street of the user's address.
    - `city` (string): The city of the user's address.
    - `country` (string): The country of the user's address.

## Validation with Joi/Zod

- Use Joi/zod to validate incoming data for user and order creation and updating operations.
- Ensure that the data adheres to the structure defined in the models.
- Handle validation errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages in the API responses.

## Instruction

1. **Coding Quality:**
    - Write clean, modular, and well-organized code.
    - Follow consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and routes.
    - Use meaningful names that reflect the purpose of variables and functions.
    - Ensure that the code is readable.
2. **Comments:**
    - Try to provide inline comments to explain complex sections of code or logic.
3. **API Endpoint Adherence:**
    - Strictly follow the provided API endpoint structure and naming conventions.
    - Ensure that the request and response formats match the specifications outlined in the assignment.
4. **Validation and Error Handling:**
    - Implement validation using Joi for both user and order data.
    - Handle validation errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages in the API responses.
    - Implement error handling for scenarios like user not found, validation errors.
5. **Coding Tools and Libraries:**
    - Avoid the use of AI tools or libraries for generating code. Write the code manually to demonstrate a clear understanding of the concepts.
    - Utilize only the specified libraries like Express, Mongoose, Joi and avoid unnecessary dependencies.
6. **Coding Style:**
    - Consider using linting tools (e.g., ESLint) to enforce coding style and identify potential issues.
